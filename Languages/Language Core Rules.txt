LANGUAGES

Many languages are spoken throughout the sector and there are many local variations and dialects. This system is designed to showcase that diversity in a way that creates interesting situations and challenges. 

Dialect
Record Languages with a specific region: Mandate or Cluster
This represents the dialect you speak. 
Ex: Spanish(Mandate) or Bengali(Cluster)
Trade Languages do not have a dialect.

Communication Under Fire:
For the most part, you can communicate simple concepts to others even if they don't share your language or dialect so long as the situation isn't urgent or time-sensitive. 
In a tense situation, you may have to make a test to be able to communicate quickly and effectively when a language barrier is present. 
To communicate you may make an Int(Know) or Cha(Connect) check. 
DC 6 - Same language root, different dialect
DC 10 - Different languages entirely
DC 12 - alien language
+2 if you are trying to communicate quickly

Trade Languages
These are relatively simple languages made to communicate the intricacies of trade between systems. 
They have no dialect but are difficult to communicate complex concepts not related to trade. 
In a tense or urgent situation, communicating in a trade language is DC 6 and does not suffer from  the quick communication penalty. (Anyone involved in the communication must understand the trade language)
